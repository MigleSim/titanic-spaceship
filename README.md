# Spaceship Titanic Machine Learning Modelling

#### -- Project Status: In Progress

## Project Intro/Objective

**Business Problem:** 

In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system. (source: kaggle.com)
